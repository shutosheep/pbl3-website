    <h1>Security and Privacy Challenges in Web Development: An Assessment</h1>
    <p>by Shuto Tamaoka</p>
    <p>Privacy is an important issue around the world, with numerous statutes, constitutional rights, and judicial decisions seeking to protect it. Numerous countries have enacted extensive privacy protections, such as Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000, Japan's Personal Information Protection Law of 2003, Australia's Privacy Act of 1988, and Argentina's Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000.
    </p>
    <p>Although the privacy and the security has been important factor to consider when building various application or conducting the experiments when using the data provided from someone, it has been difficult to achieve to completely protect users’ privacy and security.

    </p>
    <p>From Oscar Gandy’s (1993) perspective, it is said that we done have any privacy in current era. Gandy argues that surveillance systems can be used to rationalize and control human existence, and calls for an agency to ensure the survival of privacy. However in 9/11 America, government agencies appear to be doing the opposite thing. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (2005), “Among the information kept on students were ethnicity, phone numbers, e–mail addresses, intended fields of study and extracurricular activities. The record system even included parents’ attitudes about military recruitment.”.However the system was set up before notifying the public which resulted in violation of the privacy. This established the government agencies may not be solution to privacy dilemma.

    </p>
    <p>These privacy problems can be solved by three ways, social solutions, technical solutions and legal solutions. Sullivan agrees that the first step in building protections for teenagers when starting the blogging. However there are opinions which that privacy issues requires the entire social networks to deal with the whole problem.
