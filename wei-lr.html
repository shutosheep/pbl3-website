    <h1>Smart city initiatives and related applications</h1>
    <p>by Wei xiaoang</p>
    <p>Smart cities are understood as a vague concept. The process of transforming a sustainable city into a smart city
        requires the cooperation of many institutions, the support of ICT infrastructure, the integration of sustainable
        development, green growth, and multi-stakeholder cooperation at multiple levels. Smart cities utilize networked
        infrastructure to improve economic and political efficiency, thereby achieving social, cultural, and urban
        development. The sustainable development of society and the environment is a major strategic component of smart
        cities, and smart city projects have demonstrated a strong focus on achieving social inclusion for various urban
        residents in public services. Due to complex physical infrastructure and social networks, current and future
        cities may generate a large amount of real-time data, which is supported by data-driven applications. This
        article aims to review and analyze current data-driven intelligent application practices that contribute to the
        smooth operation of urban systems and the problems they face.</p>
    <p>Cities are investing in data-driven intelligent technologies to improve performance and efficiency and generate
        large amounts of data. Finding opportunities for innovative use of these data can help governments and
        authorities predict, respond, and plan for the future. Obtaining real-time data and information can provide
        effective services, improve productivity, and bring environmental, social, and economic benefits. It also
        assists in the decision-making process and provides opportunities for community participation and participation
        by improving digital literacy and culture.</p>
    <p>The conclusion of this study [1] is that the implementation of intelligent people, intelligent living, and
        intelligent governance methods in the later stage is as important as the early implementation of intelligent
        mobility, intelligent environment, and intelligent economic measures. Cities are opening to new and transparent
        participatory governance methods, in which citizens play a crucial role. It also indicates that the new wave of
        smart cities with real-time data is promoting citizen participation, focusing on human and social capital as
        important components of future cities.</p>
    <p>Most directly relevant to the design of the applications our group is looking for in vending machines is a new
        model for GPS-based mobile app development. It can find the nearest place and has had a huge impact on the
        development of smart cities. The author of reference [2] proposes that “Traveler’s Companion is a mobile GPS
        application” and the paper is titled “Mobile Web Application with Shortest Path Finder”. According to this
        article, this application is designed to find the shortest path for real estate agents. According to this
        article, the Sidekick application helps their target audience find the shortest and correct path using this
        application, and they can save 10% on their gas bills. This is a Web based application developed using HTML5,
        CSS, JQuery in.NET with SQL database and Google Maps technology. And the paper [3] aims to use React-Native GPS
        technology (Global Positioning System) to find the nearest place in the category of user needs. I think this
        will be very useful for the rest of our application design.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, smart cities leverage data-driven technologies for efficiency, growth, and inclusion. Real-time
        data and intelligent apps drive decision-making and citizen participation. Integration is key for success.
        GPS-based mobile apps provide optimal paths. These technologies empower transparent governance. Data-driven
        applications enhance urban systems in smart cities. In addition,the integration of GPS-based technology in
        data-driven intelligent applications proves highly valuable for our specific application. This technology
        facilitates optimal path finding and location-based services, aligning with our objectives and enhancing the
        functionality of our application in the context of smart cities.</p>
