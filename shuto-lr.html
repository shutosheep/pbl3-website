    <h1>Data sources and APIs with Smart City</h1>
    <p>by Shuto Tamaoka</p>
    <p>Data collection has been one of the important process during the research. This data collection can be completed
        with various ways. However, using the Application Programming Interfaces has been one of the popular way for
        collecting the data. But there seems to be negative points with this method. I will list some negative points
        and one of the method they use to mitigate the negatives, regarding the usage of APIs of social media companies
        provide .</p>
    <p>Firstly, it lacks reliability. Although the large amount of data collected with APIs are useful, it is difficult
        to determine if the data is reliable or not. The problem with this is that the API provider lacks the
        transparent of API they provide. For example, in case of Twitter API, they could remove the commercialized
        specific sets of data. Another reason which lacks the reliability is that there are limited number of API calls
        for an hour. There are possibilities that there will be missing data but without noticing it. (Lomborg, S. &amp;
        Bechman, A. 2014)</p>
    <p>Secondly, there might be legal or ethical issues. This is because the content which APIs provide might be
        considered as private for those who are participating. For instance, Facebook content can be considered as
        semi-private although, it is likely that the content is more public by default. (Stutman, Gross &amp; Acquisti
        2012) Although the content which we post on social media may include personal informations, it is unclear that
        using what information is considered as privacy sensitive action.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, the anonymization is used during the procedure of data collection and data processing. Anonymizaing the
        data when publishing the papers to public has been the standard in this field. However it is said that on
        Twitter, it is possible to expose the author’s identity with string search of text from the acount’s tweet.
        (cf. Bchmann forthcoming; Lomborg 2012) Although the anonymization method will certainlly mitigate the effect to
        identify the users, it might be impossible to completely anonymize the used datasets or charts produced with
        previous datasets.</p>
    <p>Since our team’s goal is to create a map which contains various information such as vending machine, trash cans,
        restrooms, etc… I assume we do not have to care much about data privacy when using the APIs. However we do need
        to annonymize the dataset, and the data we produced with it when we are using the data which can violate one’s
        privacy.</p>
