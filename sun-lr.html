    <h1>User Experience and interface design with Smart City</h1>
    <p>by Sun Wenhuan</p>
    <p>This article examines the issues that interactive app designers face when using design tools and how design tools
        can support these needs. Through two studies based on grounded theory, the authors identified 20 needs of
        designers and validated the findings through interviews and focus group discussions. The findings show that
        designers have many unsupported needs, each of which provides an entry point for improving the design tool.</p>
    <p>“Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design,” written by Bill Buxton, aims to help
        designers use sketching to better understand user needs, explore solutions, and iterate designs. The book
        emphasizes the importance of sketch design as a way of thinking, emphasizing that design is an iterative process
        that requires close cooperation and observation with users, and advocates the use of sketches as a tool for
        design communication and sharing. Through practice and case studies, the book provides practical demonstrations
        and inspirations, applicable to various design fields, from hardware to software, from interactive devices to
        user interfaces, providing designers with valuable guidance and practical experience.</p>
    <p>“About Face 3” introduces the basic concepts and methods of interaction design, designed to help designers create
        pleasing, easy-to-use, and highly interactive products and applications. The book provides a comprehensive
        design guide, covering aspects such as user research, user needs analysis, information architecture, interface
        design, and interaction design. It emphasizes the principles of user-centered design and encourages designers to
        deeply understand user needs, behaviors, and goals to create design solutions that meet user expectations and
        needs. Using practical examples and specific techniques, the book shows how to build clear, consistent, and
        intuitive user interfaces, and offers practical advice on user testing and iterative design.</p>
