    <h1>Vending Machine with IoT Infrastructure and Data Analytics</h1>
    <p>by Wei xiaoang</p>
    <p>IoT brings a new age for IT technologies and can change our life and job to a more intelligent and modern stage. The research and application of component technologies and the new application mode of IoT such as sea computing can facilitate the IoT to a more widely fields.

    </p>
    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology paradigm where connected devices and sensors share data over a network to solve problems and provide new services. It enables machines and devices to interact globally. Iot technology connects objects to the Internet through sensing devices to achieve information exchange, communication and intelligent management. This technology has the potential to transform how we live and work by creating a smarter and more modern environment. Research into component technologies and new application models, such as Marine computing, can further expand the scope of iot. Future research should prioritize the development of more efficient algorithms for information fusion in heterogeneous iot systems to improve their performance [1].

    </p>
    <p>IoT technology is expected to enable new solutions to innovative problems and large markets. In this regard, the synergies of wireless sensor data collection and cloud data or local data analysis should play an important role in addressing social issues in health, care, disaster mitigation, security, energy and other aspects. Collecting big data and discovering its value in a smart way through the analysis of cloud computing is a current trend.

    </p>
    <p>A vending machine (VM) is a beverage virtual machine that can operate independently to provide beverage or snack purchase transactions. Vending machines require precise changes based on product prices when fulfilling the buyer's duty to provide the desired product. This virtual machine technology, especially in the development of the Internet and smart business, has advanced and become easier for users to use [2].

    </p>
    <p>The concept of using ubiquitous vending machines to build an infinite community-based IoT infrastructure proposed in literature [3] is very similar to the theme of our upcoming vending machine-finding website. It presents beacon-based data propagation applications using a simple flood routing mechanism as a promising solution for using wireless IoT infrastructure. They developed an IoT Network Visualization Tool (IoT VIS) that, once given the location of a distributed IoT router (IoT-GWS), can easily and intuitively design a mesh topology network.
