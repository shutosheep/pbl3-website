    <h1>Geolocation and mapping Technology with Smart City</h1>
    <p>by Manami Yano</p>
    <p>At the current moment, smart cities are emerging as a result of the quick advancement of IT technology. This
        literature review describes how smart cities and location information are integrated and in what situations they
        are used.</p>
    <p>First, to track patients’ ongoing health difficulties, sophisticated systems have evolved thanks to substantial
        advancements in health monitoring technology. Geolocation technology enables the real-time tracking and
        monitoring of patient’s vital signs like blood pressure and body temperature. A proposed smart healthcare system
        enables continuous patient health monitoring by fusing GSM and GPS technology. Data is collected by certain
        sensors and compared to customizable thresholds established by healthcare professionals. A GSM module is used to
        send a short message service (SMS) to the doctor in an emergency along with measured values. Additionally, GPS
        gives the people being watched their current location. Within the framework of a smart city, this incorporation
        of geolocation technology enhances patient monitoring and makes efficient medical services possible. (Li, D.
        2012)</p>
    <p>Second, geolocation technology has many applications and is crucial for the growth of smart cities. Geolocation
        facilitates location-based services, real-time navigation, and route optimization in the context of urban
        mobility. People can travel more smoothly and conveniently if they have access to the most recent information
        about traffic patterns, available public transportation routes, and parking spots. The management of urban
        resources and infrastructure is aided by geolocation. Informed decisions about resource allocation,
        infrastructure development, and land use can be made by authorities with the help of geolocation data
        integration in urban planning and management systems. This study helps pinpoint the best places for
        transportation networks, streamline energy distribution, and enhance waste disposal techniques. (Aziz, K. 2016)
    </p>
    <p>Third, geolocation technology is essential for improving emergency preparedness and management in smart cities.
        It provides effective resource dispatching, location-based alerts to locals during emergency situations, and
        real-time tracking of emergency vehicles. However, privacy problems arise when big data about people’s
        whereabouts and activities is gathered by smart cities. A balance between security and privacy must be struck.
        It becomes crucial to implement data collection systems with privacy protection while still guaranteeing
        emergency response capabilities. In order to guarantee security and privacy, it is crucial to protect
        communications between users, servers, and networked devices. (Elmaghraby, A. 2014)</p>
    <p>Thus, geolocation technology is a key enabler in the context of smart cities. Its applications in urban
        transportation, public safety, infrastructure management, and healthcare monitoring support the creation of
        environments that are efficient, livable, and sustainable. Therefore, our application also seeks a better life
        by integrating location information and Smart City.</p>
