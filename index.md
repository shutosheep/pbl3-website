## Our application:

Vending machine finder
This app's objective is to give users a simple way to locate nearby vending machines and obtain pertinent details including menu items, costs, and other essential data. For easy accessibility across various devices, the app will be developed as a website.


## Application features:

The vending machine app will include the following core features:

- Location-based Search: 
    - The API may include geolocation information for each vending machine, allowing for insights into the distribution and placement of devices. 
- Detailed Information: 
    - The app includes sales data, inventory information, machine performance metrics, consumer interaction data, and environmental condition (more than 700,000 data, only focused on Japan). 
- Sales data:
    - It includes the quantity and type of beverages sold, prices, and timestamps of each transaction 
- Inventory Information:
    - It includes the current inventory of the vending machines. 
- Machine performance metrics:
    - It includes the operational status of the vending machines including uptime, downtime, maintenance records, and error reports.
- Consumer interaction data:
    - API capture data on consumer behavior including frequency of usage, popular beverage choices, and trends in purchasing patterns.
- Environmental condition:
    - It includes temperature, humidity, and power consumption of vending machines.
- Personalization:
    - It allows users to set filters to find specific items such as water
- Ratings and Reviews (social sharing):
    - It rates the vending machine from 1 to 5 stars, and shares information such as whether this vending machine has cheap beverages or is broken. 


All information is included in Coca-Cola bottlers Japan API

## Additional Features:

If there is sufficient time, the following features will be added:

- Trash can location:
    - It provides information on nearby trash can locations for user convenience. API data cannot be found, so data collection is needed. 
- Real-time information:
    - It displays real-time data to indicate whether specific items are sold out or available in the vending machine.
- Gamification elements:
    - It incorporates gamification elements, such as stamp collecting, loyalty rewards, or roulette. 


## Required Technology:

The development of the vending machine app will require the following technologies:

- Front-End Development:
    - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the user interface and interactive components. React.js or Angular.js for building a dynamic and responsive application.
- Back-End Development:
    - Node.js or Python as the server-side programming language. Express.js or Django is the web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses. PostgreSQL or MongoDB is the database management system for storing collected data.
- APIs and Data Sources:
    - Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan API for accessing vending machine data (sales data, inventory Information, machine performance metrics, consumer interaction data, and environmental condition are included). Also, collect vending machine data around the Minamikusatsu area.
